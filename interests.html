            <h3>I love Computers</h3>
            <p>
                You can say that computers are my first love. My father used to bring his company laptop on Saturdays and I used to play with that laptop, that's where I got my interest in computers. I've been playing with devices since I was 8 or 9 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to know every single bit about computers and how they operate. Not computers but all the smart devices that we use today.
