            <h2>Book Reading</h2>
            <p>
                I love to read books, it is a hobby that I recently developed. Reading books is very calming and it can keep me busy for hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the books that I've read in the past are "Always Think Big" by "Jim McIngvale" and "The Theory of Everything" by "Professor Stephen Hawking".<br>
                The only thing I can tell after reading these books is that both the books are great. If you are looking for something inspirational and want to know how to manage your time, "Always Think Big" is a great book that I can suggest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book that I'm currently reading is "The Magic of Thinking Big" by "David Schwartz".

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
                Listening to music is a thing that I do most of the time (I think most of us also do). Listening to music gives me peace and appreciation of the work done by artists and musicians.<br>

                I like Lofi and EDM music. If you don't know about these genres, Lofi music is like calming music that helps to focus and even in some cases doctors also recommend listening to Lofi Music. Talking about EDM music, it stands for "Electro Dance Music" which is produced with digital software. It contains high beats and bass.
